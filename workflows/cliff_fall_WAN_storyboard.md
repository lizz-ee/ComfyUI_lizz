## WAN WORKFLOW SETUP

For each beat, use WAN's Start-End Frame workflow:
1. Load START frame in first image input
2. Load END frame in second image input
3. Set transition duration (see beat duration above)
4. Generate interpolated frames
5. Move to next beat

**Advantages:**
- Smooth transitions controlled by AI understanding of motion
- Each beat is self-contained
- Easy to adjust individual beat timing
- Natural motion between poses
- Better than simple frame interpolation
