## Happy Little Accidents

If the style isn't quite right:
- Too photorealistic? Add "oil painting, thick brushstrokes, painterly" to prompt
- Too cartoonish? Add "realistic proportions, detailed rendering"
- Colors too muted? Add "vibrant, saturated colors, rich pigments"
- Too soft? Add "sharp details, defined edges, high contrast"

Remember: There are no mistakes, just happy little accidents! 🎨
