- 16 frames between each keyframe = 240 total frames
- At 24fps = 10 seconds of footage
- At 30fps = 8 seconds of footage

**Camera Movement Notes**:
- Frames 1-3: Slow pull-back (crane up and away)
- Frames 4-6: Tilt down, following subject

## ANIMATION INTERPOLATION STRATEGY

### Method 1: RIFE (Recommended)
1. Import 15 keyframes in sequence
2. Set interpolation: 16x between frames
3. Export at 24fps
4. Result: Smooth 10-second sequence

### Method 2: After Effects
1. Import keyframes as sequence
2. Apply "Pixel Motion Blur"
3. Time remapping for slow-motion feel
4. Add subtle camera shake/motion blur

### Method 3: AI Video Tools
- **Runway Gen-3**: Upload keyframes, specify "falling through air, smooth motion"
- **Pika Labs**: Great for character animation interpolation
- **Kling AI**: Excellent at maintaining character consistency
