## POST-PRODUCTION WORKFLOW

### Option A: Mixed Pipeline (Recommended)
1. **Generate 33 keyframes** using FLUX workflow at 1024×720
2. **Process each beat** with recommended pipeline:
   - Simple beats (1, 4, 8): WAN Start-End
   - Complex beats (2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12): WAN Multi-Keyframe
   - Special beat (10): AnimateDiff or WAN Multi-Keyframe
3. **Assemble Part 1** (Beats 1-9) → ~19-29 seconds
4. **Create VCR Rewind** → reverse + speed up to ~3 seconds
5. **Assemble Part 2** (Beats 10-12) → ~8-11 seconds
6. **Final Composite** → ~30-43 seconds
7. **Optional**: Upscale to higher resolution

### Option B: All AnimateDiff
1. **Generate 33 keyframes** using FLUX workflow at 1024×720
2. **Use AnimateDiff** with Steerable Motion/Interpolation for all beats
3. **Assemble and composite** as above
4. **Advantage**: Maximum control, prompt-guided morphing
5. **Disadvantage**: More complex setup

### Option C: All WAN Multi-Keyframe
1. **Generate 33 keyframes** using FLUX workflow at 1024×720
2. **Use WAN Multi-Keyframe** for all beats (including 2-frame beats)
3. **Assemble and composite** as above
4. **Advantage**: Consistent pipeline
5. **Disadvantage**: Might be overkill for simple transitions
