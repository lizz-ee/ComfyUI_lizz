  COMFYUI MODELS MIGRATION TO D:\models
==============================================================================

STATUS: IN PROGRESS

WHAT WAS DONE:
--------------

1. Created directory structure on D:\models with folders:
   - checkpoints/
   - vae/
   - loras/
   - diffusion_models/
   - clip/
   - unet/
   - controlnet/
   - embeddings/
   - upscale_models/
   - style_models/
   - photomaker/
   - vae_approx/
   - clip_vision/

2. Created extra_model_paths.yaml configuration file
   - Location: C:\Users\User\Desktop\ComfyUI_lizz\extra_model_paths.yaml
   - Set D:\models as the base_path
   - Marked as is_default: true (for auto-download to this location)

3. Currently copying 85GB of models from C: to D: drive
   - Source: C:\Users\User\Desktop\ComfyUI_lizz\models\
   - Destination: D:\models\

HOW IT WORKS:
-------------

ComfyUI reads the extra_model_paths.yaml file on startup and automatically:
- Scans D:\models\ for all model files
- Uses D:\models\ as the default download location for new models
- ComfyUI Manager will automatically download to D:\models\

The "is_default: true" setting ensures that:
- All new model downloads from ComfyUI Manager go to D:\models\
- The folder appears first in the model selection dropdowns
- It's used for all default file operations

NEXT STEPS:
-----------

1. Wait for the copy operation to complete (85GB total)
2. Restart ComfyUI to load the new configuration
3. Verify models are detected from D:\models\
4. Test loading a workflow to confirm everything works
5. Once verified, delete C:\Users\User\Desktop\ComfyUI_lizz\models\ to free up C drive space

IMPORTANT NOTES:
----------------

- DO NOT delete the C:\models\ folder until you verify D:\models\ works!
- ComfyUI must be restarted for the new paths to take effect
- All future ComfyUI Manager downloads will automatically go to D:\models\
- The extra_model_paths.yaml file is checked into git for backup

VIDEO GENERATION MODELS:
------------------------

Models ready for lizzchar video generation:
- LTX Video: ltx-video-2b-v0.9.1.safetensors (5.4GB) - READY
- Mochi-1: Downloading via ComfyUI Manager
- Hunyuan Video: Downloading via ComfyUI Manager (text-to-video + image-to-video)

All future video model downloads will go directly to D:\models\diffusion_models\
